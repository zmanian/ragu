//! # `ragu_arithmetic`
//!
//! This crate contains arithmetic traits and utilities that are common in the
//! Ragu project.
//!
//! ## Cycles of Elliptic Curves
//!
//! Ragu is parameterized by a cycle of elliptic curves defined over large prime
//! fields. Curves like these, particularly cycles of Koblitz curves, are used
//! in [Zcash](https://z.cash/) because they are useful for building recursive
//! SNARKs. The concrete parameters are defined by an implementation of the
//! [`Cycle`] trait. As long as such an implementation satisfies the requisite
//! API contracts and passes any applicable (static) assertions, it is supported
//! by Ragu.
//!
//! Currently, the only implementation of the [`Cycle`] trait is provided by the
//! [`ragu_pasta`](https://crates.io/crates/ragu_pasta) crate, which provides
//! support for the [Pasta
//! curves](https://electriccoin.co/blog/the-pasta-curves-for-halo-2-and-beyond/).
//! In fact, many of the common traits used throughout Ragu are actually defined
//! in the [`pasta_curves`] crate, which provides the actual implementations of
//! the Pasta curves and fields, and we
//! [currently](https://github.com/tachyon-zcash/ragu/issues/1) rely on those
//! traits in this crate for compatibility and interoperability reasons.
//!
//! ## FFTs
//!
//! Ragu targets the Pasta curves because they are designed to support efficient
//! multi-point evaluation and interpolation of polynomials through the use of
//! (radix-2) [Fast Fourier
//! Transforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) (FFTs).
//! Ragu itself attempts to minimize the usage of FFTs, but they are still
//! convenient in some cases and necessary for some applications and SNARK
//! protocols.
//!
//! We currently require curves to have the high 2-adicity property needed to
//! support these evaluation domains, essentially limiting users to the Pasta
//! curves. However, this is not an inherent requirement of the cryptography and
//! future versions of Ragu may support cycles such as the one formed by
//! [sec**p**256k1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1)/sec**q**256k1, which
//! do not have this high 2-adicity property but are used in many
//! cryptocurrencies.
//!
//! ## Endomorphisms
//!
//! Koblitz curves are of the form $y^2 = x^3 + b$ and their base and scalar
//! fields have size $p \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$ and thus implement
//! [`WithSmallOrderMulGroup<3>`]. This means they support an efficient
//! endomorphism that can be used to accelerate scalar multiplication, and this
//! is leveraged extensively in Ragu.
//!
//! The Pasta curves have this form, and so does the secp256k1/secq256k1 cycle.
//!
//! ## Algebraic Hashes
//!
//! Due to their superior performance in arithmetic circuits, so-called
//! arithmetic hash functions are used in Ragu. In particular, Ragu leans
//! heavily on [Poseidon](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/458). Implementations of
//! [`Cycle`] provide parameters for the Poseidon permutation over the requisite
//! fields by implementing the [`PoseidonPermutation`] trait.
