# Run all fuzz targets. Defaults to 30 seconds each, sequential.

# Usage:
#   ./fuzz.sh                                 # 30s each, sequential, no ASAN
#   ./fuzz.sh 60                              # 1 min each, sequential
#   ./fuzz.sh 300 -j                          # 5 min each, parallel
#   DICT=1 ./fuzz.sh                          # Load dict.txt
#   ASAN=1 ./fuzz.sh                          # Re-enable AddressSanitizer
#   ACCEL_MSM=1 ./fuzz.sh                      # Include accel-msm commitment target
#   ./fuzz.sh summarize <target> <file>       # Decode a corpus/crash input
#   ./fuzz.sh triage <file>                   # Triage a fuzz_witness_cheat crash
#
# The DICT=1 path passes -dict=dict.txt to libFuzzer. Empirical comparison
# (60s on fuzz_element_ops): roughly flat coverage with a small features
# decrease; on fuzz_poseidon_sponge: small features and corpus increase.
# Worth trying for Poseidon-heavy targets in longer runs.
#
# By default this script passes `-s none` to cargo-fuzz, skipping
# AddressSanitizer for a large throughput win on simulator-heavy targets
# — measured ~70% on fuzz_witness_cheat (50k → 84k exec/s), ~30% on
# fuzz_poseidon_sponge, ~10% on fuzz_element_ops. ASAN catches memory
# bugs (UAF, OOB on unwise unsafe, leaks across `Simulator::simulate`
# closures); to opt back in, set ASAN=1. The weekly cron in
# `.github/workflows/fuzz-cron.yml` invokes `cargo +nightly fuzz run`
# directly and keeps ASAN regardless of this script's default. Crash
# artifacts found here should be reproduced under ASAN=1 before triaging
# to get proper allocation history.
#
# The `summarize` subcommand runs the target binary on a single corpus or
# crash file with the DEBUG_INPUT env var set, which each fuzz target
# respects: instead of running the fuzz body, the target parses the input
# via Arbitrary, prints it via Debug, and exits. Useful for triaging
# crash artifacts without manually decoding bytes.
#
# The `triage` subcommand runs fuzz_witness_cheat with TRIAGE_CHEAT=1,
# which walks the op stream tracking the cheated slot and reports how
# many downstream ops actually read it. A 0 count means the signal is a
# "dead cheat" false positive.
#
# Regenerate dict.txt via:
#   cargo +nightly run --release --bin extract_dict > dict.txt
